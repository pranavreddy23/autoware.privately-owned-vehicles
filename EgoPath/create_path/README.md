## PathDet Dataset
To train the PathDet neural network, a multi-modal dataset will be created with ground truth driving path labels, covering a variety of road types, driving conditions and weather conditions. Existing open-source lane detection datasets can be leveraged as well as datasets designed for path prediction related tasks.

The datasets used to train PathDet include:
- [TuSimple] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manideep1108/tusimple?resource=download)
- [CULane] (https://xingangpan.github.io/projects/CULane.html)
- [CurveLanes] (https://github.com/SoulmateB/CurveLanes)
- [BDD100K] (https://doc.bdd100k.com/download.html#drivable-area)
- [Comma2K19] (https://github.com/commaai/comma2k19)
- [RoadWORK] (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ILIM/roadwork_dataset/)
